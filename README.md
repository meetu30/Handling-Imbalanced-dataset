# Handling-Imbalanced-dataset
working on imbalanced dataset - Credit fraud transactions
In this Python Notebook I have used various predictive models to see how accurate they are in detecting whether a transaction is a normal payment or a fraud. 
In the dataset, the features are scaled and the names of the features are not shown due to privacy reasons. 

Learnings -
Applied and compared SMOTE over sampling technique and Random undersampling technique to deal with imbalanced dataset
Accuracy score as a metric is never used on imbalanced datasets (will be usually high and misleading), instead use f1-score, precision/recall score or confusion matrix are used
